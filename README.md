# computor-v1
this is a solver of first and second degree polynomials equations

the projects has been done with the following bonuses :

- handle natural syntax

how to use :

python resolve.py "your equation"

you have to use the equation syntax like :

- 3 * X ^ 2 = 0
- 2 + 2 * X ^ 1 + 3 * X ^ 2 = 3
- 2 * X ^ 0 + 2 * X + 3 * X ^ 2 = X ^ 2

# example :

python resolve.py "2 + 2 * X ^ 1 + 3 * X ^ 2 = 3"
